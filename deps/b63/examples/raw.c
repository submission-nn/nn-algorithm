/*
 * This example illustrates using raw events from processor PMU.
 * In Linux perf_events that's achieved by passing combination
 * of 'mask' and 'event'. Those are CPU-specific, so, this example
 * might need to be run differently or not work at all on different cpus.
 * Still, it provides a decent illustration on how to use them (and why).
 *
 * In b63, -c lpe:r<mask><event> needs to be passed as command-line argument
 * in order to read counter value.
 * For example, on old Core2 Intel processor from 2009:
 *
 * mask = 0x01 && event = 0xA1 corresponds to 'uops executed on port 0'
 * mask = 0x02 && event = 0xA1 corresponds to 'uops executed on port 1'
 * mask = 0x04 && event = 0xA1 corresponds to 'uops executed on port 2'
 * mask = 0x08 && event = 0xA1 corresponds to 'uops executed on port 3'
 * mask = 0x10 && event = 0xA1 corresponds to 'uops executed on port 4'
 * mask = 0x20 && event = 0xA1 corresponds to 'uops executed on port 5'
 *
 * memory load is executed on port 2 and memory (data) store on port 4.
 *
 * Thus, running this benchmark produces result like this:
 *
